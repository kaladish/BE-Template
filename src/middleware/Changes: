Main suggestion:
- Refactor into Typescript.

Changes:
1. Updated middleware so it doesn't query the DB when it isnt needed and added basic validation
2. Floating point math in Javascript is lacking. A good alternative is to use libraries such as Dinero.js, Currency.js, and Numeral.js
3. On the `/admin/best-profession` I considered the `paymentDate` date as reference as it wasn't clear which timestamp to consider
